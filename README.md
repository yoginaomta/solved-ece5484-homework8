 <li>Suppose a RISC machine uses overlapping register windows with:

  <ul>

   <li>10 global registers</li>

   <li>6 input parameter registers</li>

   <li>10 local registers</li>

   <li>6 output parameter registers</li>

  </ul></li>

</ol>

How large is each overlapping register window?

<ol start="2">

 <li>Suppose a RISC machine uses overlapping register windows for passing parameters between procedures. The machine has 298 registers, and each register window has 32 registers, of which 10 are global variables and 10 are local variables. Answer the following:

  <ol>

   <li>How many registers would be available for use by input parameters?</li>

   <li>How many registers would be available for use by output parameters?</li>

   <li>How many register windows would be available for use?</li>

   <li>By how much would the current window pointer (CWP) be incremented at each procedure call?</li>

 <li>Flynn’s taxonomy consists of four primary models of computation. Briefly describe each of the categories and give an example of a high-level problem for which each of these models might be used.</li>

 <li>Describe briefly and compare the VLIW and superscalar models with respect to instruction level parallelism.</li>
